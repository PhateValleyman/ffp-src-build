The files in this directory are patches against ncurses 5.9 release.

Patches are named according to the date on which I generate them, e.g.,

	ncurses-5.9-yyyymmdd.patch.gz
	
I usually upload a new patch file on Saturday evenings.  If a serious error
is found, I will make a patch that resolves that problem.

At times (generally to mark a relatively stable point), I create a rollup
patch, which consists of all changes from the release through the current date. 
If you have the rollup patch, you will not need the corresponding weekly patch
-- it's included.

Rollup patches are a shell script.  There are two flavors, e.g.,

	patch-5.9-yyyymmdd.sh.gz
	ncurses-5.9-yyyymmdd-patch.sh.bz2

The "patch-XX.sh.gz" files are the original form, and may use a mixture of
uudecode, tar and patch to extract new files or update existing ones.

The "ncurses-XXX.sh.bz2" files use only the patch program; the downloads are
slightly smaller.

Once I have uploaded a rollup patch, I remove older weekly patches.  The weekly
patches are of interest mainly to people who are mirroring development trees
with ncurses.
